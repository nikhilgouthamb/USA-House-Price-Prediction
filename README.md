# Predicting U.S. House Prices

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting U.S. house prices using various regression models. We utilized Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ridge CV, and ElasticNet CV models to predict the prices. The goal was to analyze key variables such as bedrooms, bathrooms, size, acreage, state, and city to extract intricate patterns and create accurate price predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about U.S. houses, including the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, size, acreage, state, and city.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: We cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables.
2. **Feature Selection**: We selected key features based on their importance for predicting house prices.
3. **Modeling**: We trained the following regression models:
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
   - Ridge CV
   - ElasticNet CV
4. **Evaluation**: We rigorously evaluated each model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to identify the most accurate model.

## Results
After conducting a thorough evaluation, we found that the Random Forest model outperformed the other models, achieving the lowest MAE, MSE, and the highest R-squared score.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the models.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of using regression models for predicting U.S. house prices. The insights gained from this project can be valuable for real estate professionals and investors looking to make informed decisions in the housing market.
